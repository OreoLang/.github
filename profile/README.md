👨‍🍳 We know what you're thinking... "Why another programming language?" Well, we love Oreos and we love programming, so we thought, why not combine the two? That's why we created OreoLang - the programming language for cookie lovers!

🚀 OreoLang is a native language that's still in the early stages of development. We're working hard to make it as delicious as possible, but for now, you'll have to settle for some half-baked code.

🤔 What can you do with OreoLang? Well, not much at the moment. But we're hoping to add some sweet features in the future. Stay tuned!

👩‍🍳 So go ahead and give OreoLang a bite. It's the only programming language that's sweet enough to eat (though we don't recommend actually trying that). 

🍪 Happy coding! 🍪
